## Code Comments Policy

- **NEVER add line-by-line comments in source code**
- **ONLY add comments to public classes and functions**
- Private/internal methods should NOT have comments unless explicitly requested
- Focus on clean, self-documenting code instead of excessive comments
- When adding comments to public APIs, keep them concise and focused on usage
